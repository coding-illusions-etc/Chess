# Chess
Chess using python (v2.7)
A python source code for chess. Requires user to download pygame lib on their system.

Supported by python 2.7 ( does not work on python 3.xx)

The game can be either be played by 2 players or with an AI

The AI works on the simple function of checking each possiblity for each piece and weighing them against each other. The best move is then chosen and performed.

The AI has no selectable levels.

When played in the 2 player mode, there is the feature to flip the board.

All the choices are to be chosen at the beginning, as nothing can be changed at the end.

The media shld be present in the same folder, with the code.

The GUI is inspired by the lichess chess app and the sprites are also taken from their site.
